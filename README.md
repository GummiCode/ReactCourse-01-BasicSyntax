# React 101
# R101.1: Basic React Syntax

This repo contains my initial work with React. This work is primarily based on the Udemy course "React - The Complete Guide" by Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller.

https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

The repo is split into multiple directories, each of which contains a small project.

## Initialising a Directory for REACT:

Open a Bash terminal. Navigate to the directory.

For npm:
```
npm init
```

For React syntax:
```
npm i react
```

For React DOM manipulation:
```
npm i react-dom
```

*I've yet to cover setting up Babel for next-gen JS. Will add notes when able.*
